###Customizing Your Tone
The tone your sequence will use is determined by the two oscillators located in the bottom
left of the user interface.  Both oscillators have a wave type (sin, square, saw, or custom) as well as adjustable parameters (amplitude, damping, detuning).  Combine two damped sin waves for a soft, smooth tone or pair a sin wave with a sawtooth for more gritty sound.
